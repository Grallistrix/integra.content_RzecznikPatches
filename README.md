## How to add new page

To add new page you need to create new file in the `content` directory. File name should be the same as page name.
For example if you want to add page named `about` you need to create file named `about.md`.
When you want to create a subpage you need to create a directory with the same name as subpage name and create
a new page in that directory. For example if you want to add subpage named `about` you need to create directory
named `about` and create file named `index.md` in this directory.

## What should be in the page

Every page should have the following snippet at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
created: <page creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)>
lastmod: <page last modification date (YYYY-MM-DD)>
head:
  meta:
    - name: keywords
      content: <page keywords>
    - name: robots
      content: index follow archive
    - name: author
      content: <author name>
    - name: copyright
      content: Â© 2023 KN Integra
---
```

This snippet is used to store information about the page. You can change the content of this snippet to your needs.

**Note:** You **must** use the provided snippet and update the `lastmod` key every time you change the page.

**Every pull request which doesn't update the `lastmod` key and
doesn't have the provided snippet at the top of the file will be rejected.**
